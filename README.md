# TReNDS-Neuroimaging

The competition(TReNDS) is meant to encourage approaches able to predict age plus additional continuous individual-level assessment values, given multimodal brain features such as 3D functional spatial maps from resting-state functional MRI, static functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices, and source-based morphometry (SBM) loading values from structural MRI.
We have not used 3D functional spatial maps / f-MRI scan data, because of low SNR and lack of gpu power for trainning 3dCNNs.
